I've been meaning to get back to writing for a while now. I find that a lot of what I'd like to share is too small for a blog post and a little too long-winded for Twitter. As such I've started [a Newsletter](https://leonardoborges.substack.com/) that I think fits the bill.

This newsletter will primarity focus of leadership and technology, with a few life and current events thrown in for good measure. It will be published fortnightly initially but that may change.

As for the format, it will be structured into roughly 3-4 parts:

- **The short post** - This is where I’ll share my personal perspective on technology, leadership & life in general;
- **LeadBytes** - To the point leadership and management insights;
- **TechBytes** - What’s interesting and relevant in tech;
- **Q&A, answered** - Each issue will contain a link to a form you can use to submit questions. In the following issue I’ll pick 1-2 questions and answer them in the newsletter;

I hope you will find this useful. [The first issue is out](https://leonardoborges.substack.com/p/issue-1) - [subscribe](https://leonardoborges.substack.com/subscribe) so it always lands in your inbox! :)
